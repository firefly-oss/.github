## 🌟 Mission

**Firefly** gives fintech teams and banks an **open-core** foundation to launch and scale financial products—without black boxes or lock-in.

- **Transparent by design:** audit everything, extend anything.
- **Composable architecture:** adopt domains as you grow—no rewrites.
- **Cloud-native baseline:** built for reliability, automation, and scale.

> Community-first open core with optional enterprise tooling.

---

## 🧭 What’s inside (at a glance)

- **Core Banking:** customers, accounts, products, fees, limits, pricing.
- **Ledger & Accounting:** double-entry, postings, reconciliation, audit trails.
- **Payments Hub:** orchestration, rails/connectors, settlements, FX hooks.
- **Risk & Compliance:** KYC/KYB, AML screening, sanctions, adverse media.
- **Policy / Rule Engine:** pricing, eligibility, workflow decisions.
- **Data & Telemetry:** domain events, CDC, analytics feeds, observability.
- **Integration Layer:** public APIs/SDKs, webhooks, jobs, external adapters.

---

## 🧱 Design Tenets

- **API-first** — clean, versioned contracts with SDKs.
- **Event-driven** — decoupled domains with streaming/CDC.
- **Security-led** — least privilege, signed artifacts, SBOMs.
- **Testable by default** — golden datasets, simulators, reproducible envs.
- **Observability everywhere** — tracing, metrics, actionable logs.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (typical)

- **Backend:** Java/Spring Boot 3 (WebFlux), Kotlin or Java
- **Data:** PostgreSQL, Kafka (events/streams)
- **Infra:** Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, GitHub Actions
- **Ops UI:** Angular/React (where applicable)

> Stacks may vary by repo—see each README for specifics.

---

## 🚀 Get Started

1. **Explore the repos** → domain services, SDKs, and adapters.
2. **Read each README** → local setup, environment variables, samples.
3. **Run locally** → most services ship `docker-compose` or Helm charts.
4. **Extend** → add adapters (KYC, payments, FX, core hooks).
5. **Contribute** → pick a **Good First Issue** or open a **Discussion**.
