## 🌟 Mission

**Firefly** is an **open-core banking platform** for teams who want the control, transparency, and speed of open source—without compromising on security, compliance, or scale.

- **Transparent by design:** audit everything, extend anything.
- **Composable architecture:** pick the domains you need; evolve without rewrites.
- **Cloud-native foundations:** built for scale, reliability, and automation.

---

## 🧭 What’s inside (at a glance)

- **Core Banking Domains:** accounts, customers, products, pricing, fees, limits.
- **Ledger & Accounting:** double-entry, postings, reconciliation, audit trails.
- **Payments Hub:** orchestration, rails connectors, settlements, FX hooks.
- **Risk & Compliance:** KYC/KYB providers, AML checks, screening, rule engine.
- **Policy/Rule Engine:** configurable decisions for pricing, eligibility, and flows.
- **Data & Telemetry:** events, CDC, analytics feeds, observability.
- **Integration Layer:** APIs/SDKs, webhooks, jobs, adapters to external systems.

> 🧩 **Open Core:** Community-first with optional enterprise add-ons and tooling.

---

## 🧱 Principles

- **API-first** — clean, well-typed contracts and SDKs.
- **Event-driven** — decouple domains; embrace streaming and CDC.
- **Security-led** — least privilege, signed artifacts, SBOMs.
- **Testable by default** — golden testdata, simulators, reproducible envs.
- **Observability everywhere** — tracing, metrics, and actionable logs.

---

## 🚀 Get started

1. **Explore the repos** → browse domain services, SDKs, and adapters.
2. **Read the READMEs** → each repo includes setup and local dev guides.
3. **Run locally** → most services provide docker-compose or Helm charts.
4. **Extend** → implement adapters (KYC, payments, FX, core-bank hooks).
5. **Contribute** → see `CONTRIBUTING.md` in each repo.
