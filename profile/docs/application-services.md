    S2->>O: Compensated
    O->>S1: Compensate Step 1
    S1->>O: Compensated
```

### Event-Driven Workflow Coordination
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant WF as Workflow
    participant EB as Event Bus
    participant S1 as Service A
    participant S2 as Service B
    participant S3 as Service C

    EB->>S3: Progress Event (Subscription)
    S3->>EB: Publish Ready Event
    EB->>WF: All Services Ready
    WF->>WF: Proceed to Next Phase
```

## Workflow Patterns

### State Machine Pattern
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Initiated
    Initiated --> InProgress: Start Process
    InProgress --> Suspended: Suspend
    Suspended --> InProgress: Resume
    InProgress --> Completed: Success
    InProgress --> Failed: Error
    Failed --> InProgress: Retry
    Failed --> Cancelled: Cancel
    Completed --> [*]
    Cancelled --> [*]
```

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
- **Closed State**: Normal operation with service calls
- **Open State**: Fast-fail mode when service is unavailable
- **Half-Open State**: Limited calls to test service recovery

### Retry and Backoff Strategies
- **Exponential Backoff**: Increasing delay between retry attempts
- **Linear Backoff**: Fixed delay between retries
- **Circuit Breaking**: Stop retries when failure threshold reached
- **Dead Letter Queues**: Failed message handling and analysis

## Performance & Scalability

### Performance Targets
- **Workflow Initiation**: < 500ms to start process
- **Step Execution**: < 2s per workflow step
- **Compensation**: < 10s for rollback operations
- **Process Visibility**: < 1s for status queries

### Scalability Strategies
- **Horizontal Process Distribution**: Workflow instances across nodes

- **Process State Partitioning**: Distribute workflow state by business key
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking workflow execution
- **Compensation Queue**: Separate compensation processing

### Monitoring & Observability

- **Compensation Rate**: Frequency of rollback operations
- **Error Distribution**: Error patterns and root causes

#### Business Metrics
- **Customer Onboarding Rate**: Successful customer acquisitions
- **Loan Approval Rate**: Loan origination success metrics
- **Payment Success Rate**: Payment processing reliability
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Reporting accuracy and timeliness

## Error Handling & Recovery

### Error Classification

- **Business Errors**: Business rule violations
- **System Errors**: Infrastructure and technical failures
- **Data Errors**: Data quality and validation issues

### Recovery Strategies
- **Automatic Retry**: Retry with exponential backoff
