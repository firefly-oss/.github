```

## Workflow Patterns

### State Machine Pattern
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Initiated
    Initiated --> InProgress: Start Process
    InProgress --> Suspended: Suspend
    Suspended --> InProgress: Resume
    InProgress --> Completed: Success
    InProgress --> Failed: Error
    Failed --> InProgress: Retry
    Failed --> Cancelled: Cancel
    Completed --> [*]
    Cancelled --> [*]
```

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
- **Closed State**: Normal operation with service calls
- **Open State**: Fast-fail mode when service is unavailable
- **Half-Open State**: Limited calls to test service recovery

### Retry and Backoff Strategies
- **Exponential Backoff**: Increasing delay between retry attempts
- **Linear Backoff**: Fixed delay between retries
- **Circuit Breaking**: Stop retries when failure threshold reached
- **Dead Letter Queues**: Failed message handling and analysis

## Performance & Scalability

### Performance Targets
- **Workflow Initiation**: < 500ms to start process
- **Step Execution**: < 2s per workflow step
- **Compensation**: < 10s for rollback operations
- **Process Visibility**: < 1s for status queries

### Scalability Strategies
- **Horizontal Process Distribution**: Workflow instances across nodes
- **Event Sourcing**: Append-only workflow state storage
- **Process State Partitioning**: Distribute workflow state by business key
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Non-blocking workflow execution
- **Compensation Queue**: Separate compensation processing

### Monitoring & Observability

#### Process Metrics
- **Process Throughput**: Workflows completed per time period
- **Process Duration**: End-to-end process execution time
- **Step Success Rate**: Individual step completion rates
- **Compensation Rate**: Frequency of rollback operations
- **Error Distribution**: Error patterns and root causes

#### Business Metrics
- **Customer Onboarding Rate**: Successful customer acquisitions
- **Loan Approval Rate**: Loan origination success metrics
