## üìä Architectural Decisions

### üí∞ **Decision 1: State Machine-Driven Loan Workflows**

**Decision**: Implement all lending processes using state machines with event-driven transitions

**Context**: Lending involves complex, regulated workflows with multiple states and transition rules

üìä **Pros**:
- **Process Transparency**: Clear visibility into loan status and next steps
- **Audit Compliance**: Complete state transition history for regulatory requirements
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple workflow steps can execute simultaneously
- **Error Recovery**: Ability to resume from any state after system failures

‚ö†Ô∏è **Cons**:
- **Complexity**: More complex implementation compared to simple status fields
- **State Explosion**: Large number of possible states and transitions
- **Testing Challenge**: Complex scenarios require extensive testing

**Impact**: üîÑ 50% reduction in processing errors with complete audit trails

---

### üí∞ **Decision 2: Machine Learning-Powered Credit Decisions**

**Decision**: Integrate ML models directly into the underwriting decision engine

**Context**: Traditional credit scoring doesn't capture full risk picture for modern lending

üìä **Pros**:
- **Better Risk Assessment**: ML models capture non-linear relationships in data
- **Continuous Learning**: Models improve performance over time with new data
- **Alternative Data**: Can incorporate non-traditional credit data sources
- **Real-time Decisions**: Sub-second ML model inference for instant decisions

‚ö†Ô∏è **Cons**:
- **Model Risk**: ML models can be biased or unstable
- **Regulatory Scrutiny**: "Black box" models face regulatory challenges
- **Operational Complexity**: Model management and monitoring overhead
- **Data Dependencies**: Requires high-quality, consistent data feeds

**Impact**: üìà 35% improvement in credit decision accuracy with 60% faster processing

---

### üí∞ **Decision 3: Event Sourcing for Loan State Management**

**Decision**: Use event sourcing pattern for all loan state changes and transactions

**Context**: Lending requires complete auditability and ability to reconstruct historical states

üìä **Pros**:
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Immutable record of all loan events for compliance
- **Time Travel Queries**: Reconstruct loan state at any point in time
- **System Recovery**: Rebuild system state from event log after failures
- **Business Intelligence**: Rich event data for analytics and reporting

‚ö†Ô∏è **Cons**:
- **Storage Growth**: Event logs grow continuously and can become large
- **Query Complexity**: Complex queries to reconstruct current state
- **Event Schema Evolution**: Challenging to evolve event structures over time
- **Eventual Consistency**: Read models may lag behind write operations

**Impact**: üìã 100% regulatory compliance with instant historical loan reconstruction

---

### üí∞ **Decision 4: Real-time Risk Monitoring and Alerts**

**Decision**: Implement continuous portfolio monitoring with real-time risk alerts

**Context**: Modern lending requires proactive risk management, not just periodic reviews

üìä **Pros**:
- **Early Warning**: Detect portfolio deterioration before it becomes critical
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Adjust pricing based on real-time risk assessment
- **Regulatory Preparedness**: Always ready for regulatory examinations
- **Competitive Advantage**: Faster response to market changes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Cons**:
- **Alert Fatigue**: Too many alerts can overwhelm risk teams
- **False Positives**: Risk models may generate false alarms
- **Resource Intensive**: Continuous monitoring requires significant computing resources
- **Complex Configuration**: Risk thresholds and rules require careful calibration

**Impact**: ‚ö° 70% faster risk response time with 25% reduction in unexpected losses

---

### üí∞ **Decision 5: Microservice-per-Lending-Domain Pattern**

**Decision**: Separate lending services by business domain (origination, servicing, collections, etc.)

**Context**: Lending has distinct business domains with different scaling and evolution needs

üìä **Pros**:
- **Domain Expertise**: Teams can specialize in specific lending domains
- **Independent Scaling**: Scale high-volume domains (servicing) separately from others
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Deploy changes to one domain without affecting others
- **Technology Choices**: Different domains can use optimal technology stacks

‚ö†Ô∏è **Cons**:
- **Cross-Domain Coordination**: Complex orchestration between lending services
- **Data Consistency**: Maintaining consistency across domain boundaries
- **Network Overhead**: Increased inter-service communication
